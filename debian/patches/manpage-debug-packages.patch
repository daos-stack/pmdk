Description: Mention the -debug package split
 In Debian systems, the special debug libraries (with extra assertions,
 checks and logging, not suitable for production) are placed in a separate
 binary package with the "-debug" suffix. These are only meant to be
 installed when specific troubleshooting is required. Instructions for this
 troubleshooting are included in the library manpages, and we add a note
 explaining that the respective -debug package should be installed.
