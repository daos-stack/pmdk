Package: libpmem1
Architecture: amd64 arm64 ppc64el
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory low level support library
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This library is provided for software which tracks every store to pmem and
 needs to flush those changes to durability.  Most developers will find higher
 level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more convenient.

Package: libpmem1-debug
Architecture: amd64 arm64 ppc64el
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory low level support library — debug build
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This library is provided for software which tracks every store to pmem and
 needs to flush those changes to durability.  Most developers will find higher
 level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more convenient.
 .
 This package contains a special build of this library meant for debugging
 purposes.  It contains extra logging, assertions and expensive checks that
 should not be used otherwise.

Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libpmem1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: development files for libpmem1
 libpmem provides low level persistent memory support.  In particular, support
 for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is
 provided.
 .
 This package contains libraries and header files used for linking programs
 against libpmem.

Package: libpmemobj1
Architecture: amd64 arm64 ppc64el
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libpmem1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory object store support library
 libpmemobj turns a persistent memory file into a flexible object store,
 supporting transactions, memory management, locking, lists, and a number of
 other features.

Description: Persistent Memory management tools
 The main purpose of this package is to provide a user with a set of utilities
 for off-line analysis and manipulation of pools created by pmem libraries.
 .
 The utilities may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators and
 for software developers who work on applications based on these libraries.  The
 latter may find these tools useful for testing and debugging purposes also.
