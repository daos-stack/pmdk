Architecture: amd64
Depends: libpmem1 (=${binary:Version}),
         ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory remote access support library
 librpmem provides low-level support for remote access to persistent memory
 (pmem) utilizing RDMA-capable RNICs. The library can be used to replicate
 remotely a memory region over RDMA protocol. It utilizes appropriate
 persistency mechanism based on remote node’s platform capabilities. The
 librpmem utilizes the ssh client to authenticate a user on remote node and for
 encryption of connection’s out-of-band configuration data.
 .
 This library is for applications that use remote persistent memory directly,
 without the help of any library-supplied transactions or memory allocation.
 Higher-level libraries that build on libpmem are available and are recommended
 for most applications.

Package: libvmem1
Architecture: amd64
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory volatile memory support library
 The libvmem library turns a pool of persistent memory into a volatile memory
 pool, similar to the system heap but kept separate and with its own
 malloc-style API.
 .
 libvmem supports the traditional malloc/free interfaces on a memory mapped
 file. This allows the use of persistent memory as volatile memory, for cases
 where the pool of persistent memory is useful to an application, but when the
 application doesn’t need it to be persistent.

Description: Persistent Memory management tools
 The main purpose of this package is to provide a user with a set of utilities
 for off-line analysis and manipulation of pools created by pmem libraries.
 .
 The utilities may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators and
 for software developers who work on applications based on these libraries.  The
 latter may find these tools useful for testing and debugging purposes also.
